This is an example Android application that consumes the Geoloqi
Android SDK. It's a good starting point for anyone interested in
developing with the Geoloqi location APIs.

Installation
============
This app can be compiled and run in the standard fashion using Eclipse or
the command-line Android tools and ant.

    # Build debug version
    $ ant clean debug

    # Install to device
    $ adb install bin/GeoloqiSampleAndroidApp.apk

Of course you'll also need to include the Geoloqi SDK source as a library
project for the build to successfully compile.
